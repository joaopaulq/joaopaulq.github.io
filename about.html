        <h2>I'm [Your Name]</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a freelance video journalist and documentary filmmaker living between Los Angeles & NYC.  
          For 4+ years, I worked as a video journalist at NowThis, where I produced, shot, and edited
          character-driven, highly-shareable short documentaries.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Since going freelance, I’ve worked with companies like Radical Media, Topic Studios, Sky Documentaries, 
          and Hearst Television — tackling stories that are bold, complex, and deeply human.
        </p>
        <p>
          My documentary short <em>Georgie</em> screened at festivals around the world, including DOC NYC, Aspen Shortsfest, 
          and Florida Film Festival. I also worked as Associate Producer on <em>Tell Them You Love Me</em>, 
          which premiered on Netflix in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I love strategy board games, cooking big pots of heirloom beans, 
          and traveling with my cat, Nebraska.
