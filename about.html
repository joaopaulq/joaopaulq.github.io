      <h1>I'm Jennie.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a freelance video journalist and documentary filmmaker living between Los Angeles & NYC.
      </p>
      <p>
        For 4+ years, I was a video journalist at NowThis, where I produced, shot, and edited character-driven, highly-sharable short docs. From 2020–2021, I led a coordinated project between the MacArthur Foundation, the Appeal, and NowThis to make a series of short documentaries focused on criminal justice reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since going freelance in 2021, I've worked with companies like Radical Media, Topic Studios, Sky Documentaries, Hearst Television and more — tackling stories that are bold, complex, and deeply human.
      </p>
      <p>
        My documentary short <em>Georgie</em>, screened at festivals around the world, including DOC NYC, Aspen Shortsfest, CUFF Docs, and Florida Film Festival.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also an Associate Producer on the feature doc <em>Tell Them You Love Me</em>, which hit #1 when it premiered on NETFLIX in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        After work, I absolutely love playing complicated strategy board games, cooking a big pot of heirloom beans, and traveling with my cat, Nebraska, who weirdly enough loves flights and long car rides.
